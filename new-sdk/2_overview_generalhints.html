    All distance units in Crashday are measured in meters, i.e. 1 unit is representing 1 meter.

    The Crashday coordinate system is defined as follows: when looking "into your screen" the X axis goes left/right (increasing rightwards). The Y axis defines the vertical direction up/down (increasing upwards). The Z axis is the depth extension and points "into/out of the screen" (increasing into the screen).

    Car models should be aligned as follows: the car's front points towards the positive Z direction, i.e. "into the screen".

    Don't forget to create shader files (.tex file) for each new texture you add.

    Even when working with .dds textures, you should reference to .tga (e.g. if you specify glass2.dds in your car info file, define it as glass2.tga). Crashday internally only works with uncompressed .tga textures. Whenever it is asked to look for a certain .tga, it first checks whether a .dds alternative is available. You can for example work with .tga files only in your modeling application and even if the in-game textures are only available as .dds, this is no problem.

    All files auto-generated for the mods will be put into <b>crashday/user/__tmp00.cpk</b>. You can put those files into your mod later, so it will load faster.
